In order to generate the Radiative Correction factor there are three steps that need to be done.
First generate the 5 dimension ntuple with the program in Gen5DimData.
Once it has been generated, create phi histograms with the program in PhiHist.
Finally, place the file generated by PhiHist in GenRC folder and run the program, this will generate a text file with the radiative correction factor.
